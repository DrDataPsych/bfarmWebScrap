##Short Overview: Web Scraping: Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices Website (Germany)
- Scraped every DIGA-Subpage on the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices Website (BfArM) using Python and Selenium
- Extracted information from HTML files (classes) and saved them in a data frame in Python using pandas
- Did some exploratory data analysis using Python module Pandas Profiling

##Intro: 
Germany became the first country to reimburse the prescription of digital health applications (DIGA).

The Digital Health Care Act (DVG) came into force in December 2019. It allows digital health applications (DIGA) to be prescribed by doctors or psychotherapists. The costs for the DIGAs are borne by the health insurer.

As a portfolio project, I chose to scrap information about the DIGA from the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices Website (BfArM) and to do some exploratory data analysis.
